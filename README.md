# FriendFinder App
This application is designed to take user input from a survey to create an individual profile. It will then match the user with the most compatible friend based on their answers to the survey questions and will give them the name and photo of that other user.

## Getting Started
To run this application on your local server you would need to install the npm packages included in the application. You can do this by simply running npm install in your command line when opening the application. From there you can log into the localhost on your computer and see the code at work.

This site is also deployed on Heroku. To check out the live version of the site, go to:

PS - If you're a fan of Stranger Things, you might recognize some of your potential friends!
